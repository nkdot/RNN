    "\n",
    "#### Exploding gradients\n",
    "* When gradients are very large, they're called \"exploding gradients.\"  \n",
    "* Exploding gradients make the training process more difficult, because the updates may be so large that they \"overshoot\" the optimal values during back propagation.\n",
    "\n",

    "* cost computation, \n",
    "* backward pass, \n",
    "* parameter update. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before updating the parameters, you will perform gradient clipping to make sure that your gradients are not \"exploding.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient clipping\n",
    "In the exercise below, you will implement a function `clip` that takes in a dictionary of gradients and returns a clipped version of gradients, if needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "* There are different ways to clip gradients.\n",
    "* You will use a simple element-wise clipping procedure, in which every element of the gradient vector is clipped to fall between some range [-N, N]. \n",
    "* For example, if the N=10\n",
    "    - The range is [-10, 10]\n",
    "    - If any component of the gradient vector is greater than 10, it is set to 10.\n",
    "    - If any component of the gradient vector is less than -10, it is set to -10. \n",
    "    - If any components are between -10 and 10, they keep their original values.\n",
